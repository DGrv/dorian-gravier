# Exiftool usage

	rename all mp4 with creation date from exif

	```shell
	exiftool "-filename<CreateDate" -d %Y%m%d_%H%M%%-.2nc.%%le *.mp4
	exiftool "-filename<CreateDate" -d %Y%m%d_%H%M%%-.2nc.%%le -ext mp4
	```
	
	Do not use single quote (') with cmd it will say "The system cannot find the file specified." Use double quote (").
	
	%%-.2nc permit to get a counter from 1 with 2 numbers.
	%%-c would be a counter but will not count the first file.

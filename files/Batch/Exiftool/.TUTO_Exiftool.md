# Exiftool usage

	https://ninedegreesbelow.com/photography/exiftool-commands.html
	
	```shell
	exiftool -s -G yourfile
	```
	
	-s means instead of showing the "friendly" names like "Create Date", show the names you need to use when you write ExifTool commands. So instead of "Create Date" you see "CreateDate".
	-G means also show the metadata Group to which the metadata tag belongs.
	


	rename all mp4 with creation date from exif

	```shell
	exiftool "-filename<CreateDate" -d %Y%m%d_%H%M%%-.2nc.%%le *.mp4
	exiftool "-filename<CreateDate" -d %Y%m%d_%H%M%%-.2nc.%%le -ext mp4
	exiftool "-filename<FileModifyDate" -d %Y%m%d_%H%M%%-.2nc.%%le *.jpg
	```
	
	Do not use single quote (') with cmd it will say "The system cannot find the file specified." Use double quote (").
	
	%%-.2nc permit to get a counter from 1 with 2 numbers.
	%%-c would be a counter but will not count the first file.

[JSON Parser]
; Suppress logging of errors at or below this level.
; STRICT: Log all deviations from the original JSON spec.
; OK: The original JSON spec plus the following:
;     * strings can contain characters with ASCII values less than 0x20 (includes '\t')
; NAN_INF: Do not log errors when NaN, Infinity, and -Infinity are parsed.
; JSONC: The following errors are not logged:
;     * JavaScript single-line '//' and multi-line '/*...*/' comments
;     * NaN and +/-Infinity
; JSON5: Everything in the JSONC and NAN_INF levels is not logged, as well as the following:
;     * singlequoted strings
;     * commas after the last element of an array or object
;     * unquoted object keys
;     * see https://json5.org/ for more.
logger_level=NAN_INF
; When the document is parsed, show a prompt to see syntax errors in the document.
offer_to_show_lint=True

[Performance]
; Automatically validate .json, .jsonc, and .jsonl files every 2 seconds, except very large files
auto_validate=False
; How many seconds of user inactivity before the plugin re-parses the document. Minimum 1.
inactivity_seconds_before_parse=2
; Files larger than this number of megabytes have the following slow actions DISABLED by default:
; * Automatically turning on the JSON lexer.
; * Automatic parsing of the file on opening and approximately 2 seconds after every edit.
max_file_size_MB_slow_actions=4

[Tree View]
; The longest length of a JSON array or object that gets all its children added to the tree view. Longer iterables get only some of their children added to the tree.
max_json_length_full_tree=10000
; Should each node in the tree have an image associated with its type?
tree_node_images=True

[JSON formatting]
; Ask before pretty-printing JSON Lines documents, ignore requests to pretty-print, or pretty-print without asking?
ask_before_pretty_printing_json_lines=ASK_BEFORE_DOING
; The number of spaces between levels of JSON when pretty-printing
indent_pretty_print=4
; If true, using the 'Compress JSON' plugin command will remove ALL unnecessary whitespace from the JSON. Otherwise, it will leave after the colon in objects and after the comma in both objects and arrays
minimal_whitespace_compression=True
; How JSON is pretty printed.
; Google style (default):
; {
;     "a": [
;         1,
;         [
;             2
;         ]
;     ]
; }
; Whitesmith style:
; {
; "a":
;     [
;     1,
;         [
;         2
;         ]
;     ]
; }
; PPrint style:
; {
;     "algorithm": [
;         ["start", "each", "child", "on", "a", "new", "line"],
;         ["if", "the", "line", "would", "have", "length", "at", "least", 80],
;         [
;             "follow",
;             "this",
;             "algorithm",
;             ["starting", "from", "the", "beginning"]
;         ],
;         ["else", "print", "it", "out", "on", 1, "line"]
;     ],
;     "style": "PPrint",
;     "useful": true
; }
pretty_print_style=Google
; When JSON is pretty-printed or compressed, any comments found when it was last parsed are included.
; When pretty-printing, each comment will have the same relative location to each JSON element as when it was parsed.
; When compressing, all comments will come at the beginning of the document.
remember_comments=False
; Sort the keys of objects alphabetically when pretty-printing or compressing
sort_keys=False
; Use one horizontal tab ('\t') instead of spaces between levels of JSON when pretty-printing
tab_indent_pretty_print=False

[Miscellaneous]
; If this setting is true,
; when the regex search form is opened, or when the "Parse as CSV?" checkbox in that form is toggled on,
; JsonTools will attempt to guess whether the current document is a CSV or TSV file, and how many columns and what newline it has.
; The regex search form will take slightly longer to open if this is true.
auto_try_guess_csv_delim_newline=False
; Which type of newline to use for generated CSV files.
csv_newline=LF
; The style of key to use when getting the path or key/index of a node or line.
; See the documentation (https://github.com/molsonkiko/JsonToolsNppPlugin/blob/main/docs/README.md#key_style-and-path_separator-settings) for an explanation of each type.
; This setting is IGNORED when path_separator is NOT the default "\u0001".
key_style=RemesPath
; The separator to use when formatting a path. This setting is IGNORED when it is set to "\u0001" (the default).
; This MUST have exactly one character, which CANNOT be any of the characters in the following JSON string: "\"0123456789"
; The algorithm for formatting an object key or array index is as follows:
; ===========
; if the key is an array index:
;     format it as plaintext (for example, index 10 becomes "$10" if "$" was the path_separator)
; if the key contains the path_separator:
;     format it as a JSON string (for example, key "foo" would be formatted as "/foo" if "/" was the path_separator)
; else if the key starts with (_ or a-z or A-Z) and all its other characters are (_ or 0-9 or a-z or A-Z):
;     format it as plain text (for example, key "_foo" becomes "/_foo" if "/" was the path_separator, but "_\"_foo\"" if "_" was the path_separator)
; else:
;     format it as a JSON string (for example, the key "a b" would be formatted as "/\"a b\"" if the path_separator was "/" even though it doesn't contain the path_separator)
path_separator="\u0001"
; When running tests, skip the tests that send requests to APIs and the RemesPath fuzz tests
skip_api_request_and_fuzz_tests=True
; Specify one of these chars for each toolbar icon you want to show, in the order you want:
; ('t' = tree view, 'c' = compress, 'p' = pretty-print, 'o' = path to current position)
; This setting will take effect the next time you start Notepad++.
; If you want there to be NO toolbar icons, enter a character that does not represent an icon; do NOT leave this field empty.
toolbar_icons=tcpo
; When selecting every JSON in the file, start trying to parse only at these characters.
; Only JSON valid according to the NAN_INF logger_level is tolerated.
; Example: if "[{ are chosen (default), we consider only potential strings, arrays, and objects.
; If "[{tf are chosen, we consider potential strings, arrays, objects, and booleans.
try_parse_start_chars="[{

[Styling]
; The font size (in points) for the tree viewer. For reference, the default value is 7.8.
tree_view_font_size=7.8
; Use the same colors as the editor window for the tree viewer and other JsonTools forms?
use_npp_styling=True

[Random JSON]
; Use extended ASCII characters (e.g., , ñ) in strings?
extended_ascii_strings=False
; Generate random strings that match the "pattern" keyword of string schemas, and random keys that match the "patternProperties" keyword of object schemas.
generate_random_patterns=False
; Maximum length of random arrays, unless otherwise specified by the "maxItems" keyword
maxArrayLength=10
; Minimum length of random arrays, unless otherwise specified by the "minItems" keyword
minArrayLength=0

[JSON Schema]
; Maximum number of JSON Schema validation problems to log before the validator stops
max_schema_validation_problems=64

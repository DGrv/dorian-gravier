; The configuration is stored in an ini-like syntax.
; The global section defines the indicator ID used for styling.
; A line starting with a semicolon is treated as a comment line, NO inline comment is supported.
; ONLY styling of the text foreground color is supported.
; Updates to the configuration are read when the file is saved and applied immediately
; when the buffer of the configured lexer is reactivated.
[global]
; The ID of the indicator used to style the matches.
; The plugin will try to request an ID from Npp, but if this fails, it will fall back to the ID configured here.
; If there are conflicts with indicators used by Npp or other plugins, change this value.
; The expected range is between 0 and 35; according to Scinitilla.
indicator_id=0
; If specifying an offset, it will affect both the start and end lines.
; For example, if the currently visible lines range from 100 to 150 and an offset=10 is given,
; the regular expressions are matched with the text from lines 90 to 160.
offset=0
; The ID of the style used to display regex errors.
; If there are conflicts with other styles used by Npp or other plugins, change this value.
; The expected range is between 0 and 255; according to Scinitilla.
regex_error_style_id=30
; The color used by the style.
; For an explanation of how this color can be defined, see the following description of the regexes and their colors.
regex_error_color=0x756ce0
; Using the RGB format instead of the default BGR format.
; The expected values are 0 (BGR) or 1 (RGB)
use_rgb_format=0

; Each configured lexer must have a section with its name,
; (NOTE: use the menu function "Enhance current language" as it takes care of the correct naming)
; followed by one or more lines with the syntax
; color[optional whitelist] = regular expression.
; A color is a number in the range 0 - 16777215.
; The notation is either pure digits or a hex notation starting with 0x or #,
; such as 0xff00ff or #ff00ff.
; Please note:
; * red goes in the lowest byte (0x0000FF)
; * green goes in the center byte (0x00FF00)
; * blue goes in the biggest byte (0xFF0000)
; * this BGR order might conflict with your expectation of RGB order.
; * see Microsoft COLORREF documentation https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/gdi/colorref
; If the RGB format is to be used, set the global variable use_rgb_format=1

; The optional whitelist is expected in the form of [1,3,16 ... ] which correspond to the style IDs of the current lexer.
; A whitelist is only useful if an excluded_styles line has been configured
; and means that this regex will ignore the excluded_styles list for these IDs and apply its style.
; See excluded_styles for further information.

; The optional line of excluded_styles is expected in the form of
; excluded_styles = 1,2,3,4,5 ...
; The numbers refer to the style IDs used by the lexer and
; can be taken from the file stylers.xml or USED_THEME_NAME.xml
; and in case of UDLs the mapping is only described in the source code
; https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/master/lexilla/include/SciLexer.h
; starting from SCE_USER_STYLE_DEFAULT

; The regular expression syntax is explained at

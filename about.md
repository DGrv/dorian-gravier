# Welcome

Welcome to my website where I share some information about me and my experience and store coding tips and other map tools that I am using.

I am French, a bit of a traveller, lived in Sweden, Germany and speaking German and English.

Good in programing and found of outdoor experiences, a bit of a crazy mix.


# Actual position

Actually working as an Data Analyst & HTS Robotic Specialist in a private pharmaceutical company ([HDC GmbH](http://hit-discovery.de/index.php?id=2) in Konstanz, Germany). We are providing services regarding High-Throughput Screening ([HTS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-throughput_screening)), High-Content Screening ([HCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-content_screening)) and compound management.

As responsible of 4 robotic lines, my tasks are relatively diverse, from programming robots, complete data processing and analysis (with [R](https://www.r-project.org/ mainly) of the company (complete data analysis workflows and solution build from the scratch), optimising robotic and working workflows, assay development regarding automation, quality control of results and troubleshooting, maintenance of all the devices (liquid handling, robots, incubators ...).

Without having studied this engineering and biotechnology field, the challenge has been to start from 0 and this in different areas in a new created company without having expert to support me.
My experience acquired during my career is based on several skills that I consider valuable and that I am constantly trying to improve. High adaptation and autonomie capabilities, looking for organisational work  and responsibilities, focus on communication and team spirit, interest in problem solving and process optimisation are the one that speak me the most.

I am doing video editing with open source tools. In addition I used home made built scripts that are doing what I need. The goal is too spend as little time as possible and have a consistent style.
I am really happy about it but for sure it is highly limited regarding creativity on the video content but make me highly creative on the progamming level. I learned so much because of this.

Whatever

I am trying to build a code that could draw lines following roads. A lot of tools are existing for this but I wanna learn and do my own. Of course I am using other tools like [Leaflet-Routing-machine](http://www.liedman.net/leaflet-routing-machine/) and [GraphHopper](https://www.graphhopper.com/) via [lrm-graphhopper](https://github.com/perliedman/lrm-graphhopper).

- I could create an example of adding markers, being able to drag them and remove them with right clik (here the [CodePen](https://codepen.io/Dorigrv/pen/BbKrBP))
- [A first try of using GraphHopper by adding points](https://codepen.io/Dorigrv/pen/bZpLwo?editors=0010). I have an array with the data from the points but this one is not dynamic when the routing is done ...

title: Leaflet ready to use
---

I created a Leaflet map with 2 layers for the moment and all my gpx.
The goal is to be able to have an overview of the projects and possibilities I have when I want to organise something, to give ideas to thers and at the same time to learn a bit more about the surroundings. It is always useful to know, "Ah ja I was there ... oh this is not far ...".

The gpx are sorted depending on projects and on type :

- <span style="color:green">Green : Bike</span>
- <span style="color:red">Red : Hike</span>
- <span style="color:blue">Blue : SkiTour</span>

Then comes a bit more transparent gpx with a dash array, this are 'Projects' :)

I had to solve little difficulties with Leaflet but things are working great.
Here a small list to avoid other people to get in the same troubles:

- load all gpx in a folder
  - use a for loop
  - create a variable with all the relative paths of the gpx
    - Created automatically with an [Rscript](/files/gpx/R_Create_variable_for_js-html.R), listing the files depending on where there are. It is creating a [file](/files/gpx/Name_var_js-html_tocopy_in_leaflet.txt) which I have to copy the content in the js code.
    - The list of the gpx at the end is also done this way ([here the file](/files/gpx/Link_gpx_tocopy_in_leaflet.md))
- Fullscreen option
  - using [leaflet-fullscreen](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.fullscreen)
- Making layers for the maps
- Making layer for the different type of gpx
- loading only 1 map at a time and not both
  - little thing to know : in the L.map() option 'layers' define only 1 layer, but load the 2 in L.control.layers()

Howerver there are still things that I would like to do :

- [ ] Use leaflet.Elevation
- [x] Highlight track by selecting

Just play with it :)

A new tile layer is available in my [leaflet page](/leaflet.html).
[Kompass](https://www.kompass.de/wanderkarte/) map from Austria.
I was inspired by the sublime [Leaflet.Map.MultiVendors](https://dominique92.github.io/MyLeaflet/src/Leaflet.Map.MultiVendors/) from [Dominique92](https://github.com/Dominique92).

I also found on his [Leaflet.GeoJSON.Ajax](https://github.com/Dominique92/Leaflet.GeoJSON.Ajax) repository a [great example and data](https://dominique92.github.io/MyLeaflet/src/Leaflet.GeoJSON.Ajax/) of refuge in the Alps. Exactly what I am actually looking for.
I adapted little things of his pretty complex code to fit to my wish and thanks refuge.info and his contributors (*"Les contributeurs de refuges.info"*). They [created a great API](http://www.refuges.info/api/doc/) allowing the public to freely use the data of their website.

You will have then 2 new layers available:

- `Kompass`
- `POI - Refuge.info POI`

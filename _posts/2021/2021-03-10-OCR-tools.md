How can you effectively extract text from a pdf or an image ? commmonly called [OCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition) (optical character recognition).
I found 2 extremly powerfull tools based on the open source engine [Tesseract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract_%28software%29) ([Official website](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)).

I am using windows and can be both used on this OS.
One permit to convert scanned pdf to searchable pdf (as well as copiable).
The other permit to get a screenshot from an area of your screen, convert it to text and store it in your clipboard.

- [Ocrmypdf](https://github.com/jbarlow83/OCRmyPDF)
	- you need to use Ubuntu on windows [more info here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6#activetab=pivot:overviewtab)
	- update your apt: `sudo apt-get update`
	- install it: `sudo apt install ocrmypdf`
	- check the [documentation](https://github.com/jbarlow83/OCRmyPDF) for the cmds
		- here an easy example for frencg pdf: `ocrmypdf -l fra "input.pdf" "output.pdf"`
	- To install new languages (for Ubuntu)
		- check which exists: `apt-cache search tesseract-ocr`
		- install what you need: `sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr-fra`
- [normcap](https://github.com/dynobo/normcap) 
	- easy to install, just use the exe

Have a try :)
